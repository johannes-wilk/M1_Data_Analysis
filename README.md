Data Analysis practicals


Practical 1: ggplot2, cyclones

We used the library ggplot2 to visualize a complex dataset
Ggplot2 offers the possibility to display a simple and straight forward way to plot data for the observer

We made use of a dataset about cyclones and the affected people
First we displayed a simple plot
Then we labled the plot with titels and descriptions
Then we displayed a plot with 3 variables and different colors
Then we displayed several plots to include a fourth variable


Practical 2: trendlines, glaciers 

We used simple trendline calculations to see correlations between the data
We used simple point diagram
